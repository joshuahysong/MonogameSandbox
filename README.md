# Stellar Ops

Stellar Ops is planned to be a single-player top-down sandbox sci-fi role playing game where you take on the role of a character attempting to survive their way through life in a turbulent galaxy. Players will start with next to nothing and have the opportunity to work their way up to bigger ships, larger crews, and control over planets and space stations. The galaxy will feature an ai driven economy, warring factions, and dynamic storylines.

This game is currently in very, very early development. The plan is to slowly grow the game from basic game loops into the above stated goal piece by piece. Ideally once the initial game engine is completed and the first basic gameplay loop implemented the game will enter it's alpha phase where, as new features are added, the game will remain in a playable state so that players will be able to enjoy Stellar Ops during active development.
